## 2. Data
### 2.1 Postal Code
First, I will gather the name of a neighbourhood from Wikipedia.
- The postal code of the Toronto area begin with M. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M,
- The postal code of Metro Vancouver begins with V. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_V

Unlike Toronto, I will gather data on metro Vancouver which is consisted of several cities. The member of Metro Vancouver can be found following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver_Regional_District.

### 2.2 List of Neighborhoods Name
I will create a list of the name of a neighbourhood from various sources.

### 2.3 Coordinates of the Neighborhoods
Using geopy and google map, I will add coordinates for each neighbourhood and create two maps marked neighbourhoods using Folium for Toronto and Metro Vancouver.

### 2.4 Foursquare data
For each neighbourhood in two cities, I will gather the following venues:
- Schools: primary school, secondary school, college and university
- hospital and clinic
- Government agency or buildings including a police station and fire station
- Stores: Convenient store, mart, shop, drugstore
- Restaurants
- Banks
- Gas Stations
- Parks, Lakes
- etc.

### 2.5 Categorize Venues for each neighborhoods
I will classify the venue information in various criteria. Here are some criteria:
- The top 10 popular restaurant or cuisine in two cities
- The most density neighbourhoods for each category of venues
- etc.
