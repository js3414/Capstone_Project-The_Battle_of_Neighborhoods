Coursera Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

## 1. Introduction
The government of Canda announced that Canada will expand immigration program and Canada is becoming a more attractive and inclusive global destination among English-speaking countries. Toronto and Vancouver are the most preferred cities to the immigrants and many people who have plan to immigrant to Canada frequently ask which city is better. The answers are very susubjective. In most cases, people answer the question based on threir experience. Even the person who did not have an experience live in Toronto say Vancouver is better. If we present some information about the cities, it will help to understand two cities.
City information will be useful to the people who are looking for:
- where to live
- where to open own business such as Thai restaurant

### 1.1 Where to Live
For the new immigrants, where to live is one of the most important issue. If the immigrants have children, they might prefer the location near at school. Some immigrants will be happy if many amenities are within walking distance. Although google map or other map gives us many information, it is not easy to examine whole city. Instead, neighborhood data of schools, restaurants, and marts is more convienient and useful.

### 1.2 Best Place for new business
If you have a plan to open a Thai restaurant, you think where the best place is. Although the criteria for the best place is different, you want to check competitors and potential customers. You may choose Vancouver because many Thai restaurants are in Toronto but very rare in Vancouver.
