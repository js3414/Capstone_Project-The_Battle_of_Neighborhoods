## 1. Introduction

Toronto and Vancouver are well-known cities in Canada. Recently, Canada announced the immigration policy, and according to the new immigration policy, Canada will accept more immigrants. Many people who are thinking of immigration to Canada ask "Which city is better, Toronto or Vancouver?" Of course, the answer will depend on the conditions, and they have their criteria to make a decision. Although the answer or decision is subjective, if they have information about the cities it will help them make a decision.

### 1.1 Where to Live
For the new immigrants, where to live is one of the most important issues. If the immigrants have children, they might prefer the location near the school. Some immigrants happy if many amenities are within walking distance. Although google map or other map gives us much information, it is not easy to examine the whole city. Instead, neighbourhood data of schools, restaurants, and marts are more convenient and useful.

### 1.2 Best Place for new business
If you have a plan to open a Thai restaurant, you think where the best place is. Although the criteria for the best places are different, you want to check competitors and potential customers. You may choose Vancouver because many Thai restaurants are in Toronto but very rare in Vancouver.
